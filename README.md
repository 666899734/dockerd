This repository contains a Magisk and KernelSU module for running Docker on rooted Android devices.

## Prerequisites
- Magisk or KernelSU installed
- Docker Patched kernel [See More](https://gist.github.com/FreddieOliveira/efe850df7ff3951cb62d74bd770dce27)

## Quick Start & Installation

1. Download the latest zip file from the [Releases](https://github.com/mgksu/dockerd/releases/latest) page.

After installation, the Docker daemon (`dockerd`) will run automatically on boot.

## Limitation

export DOCKER_HOST="unix:///data/adb/docker/run/docker.sock"
```
You can add above lines to your shell profile (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) to set the environment variables automatically.

### Cannot connect to docker daemon
